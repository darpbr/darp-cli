# AGENTS.md

This document defines how AI agents must contribute to this repository.

## Mission

Help build DARP CLI while preserving architectural consistency.

Agents must prioritize quality over speed.

## Project Goal

DARP CLI is a package manager for AI assets.

The CLI manages reusable artifacts instead of source code libraries.

Examples:

- Prompt
- Instruction
- Skill
- Persona
- MCP Server
- Workflow

## Development Methodology

This repository follows Specification-Driven Development (SDD).

Implementation order is always:

1. Vision
2. Constitution
3. Project Context
4. Specification
5. ADR, when required
6. Plan
7. Tasks
8. Implementation
9. Tests
10. Architecture Review
11. Documentation Review
12. Quality Gates
13. Review
14. Release
15. Completed

Never skip steps.

The detailed operational definitions are in `.darp/lifecycle.md`. The shorter
workflow in `.spec/constitution.md` is not replaced; this lifecycle expands it
for execution and review.

## Specification Layout

All feature planning artifacts must live together under `.spec/specs/`.
Create one directory per feature using the format `<number>-<short-name>`:

```text
.spec/specs/002-doctor/
├── spec.md
├── plan.md
├── tasks.md
└── adr/                         # optional, when architecture decisions exist
```

Use the templates in `.spec/templates/`. Do not create active specifications,
plans, or tasks outside `.spec/specs/<number>-<short-name>/`.
The `.darp/` directory is reserved for DARP runtime contracts, while
`.agents/skills/` is reserved for skills discovered by coding agents.

## Architecture Principles

- Keep packages cohesive.
- Minimize coupling.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Keep commands independent.
- Avoid global state.
- Favor deterministic behavior.
- Design for extensibility.

## Coding Principles

- Keep functions small.
- Prefer readability over cleverness.
- Document exported APIs.
- Write tests whenever functionality is implemented.
- Never introduce unnecessary abstractions.

## Decision Hierarchy

When conflicts arise, follow this order:

1. Constitution
2. Project Context
3. Approved Specification
4. ADR
5. Plan
6. Tasks

Never override a higher-level document.

## Repository Rules

Do not:

- implement features outside an approved specification;
- create hidden behavior;
- duplicate business logic;
- introduce unnecessary dependencies.

Always:

- update documentation;
- update `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased` for user-visible changes, fixes,
  breaking changes or deprecations;
- explain assumptions;
- write implementation tasks as unchecked Markdown checkboxes (`- [ ]`);
- mark a task as complete only after its validation passes;
- leave blocked tasks unchecked and record the blocker and evidence;
- preserve backward compatibility whenever possible.

## AI Behaviour

When uncertain:

- ask for clarification;
- do not invent requirements;
- document assumptions.

When implementing:

- prefer incremental changes;
- keep commits focused;
- avoid unrelated refactoring.

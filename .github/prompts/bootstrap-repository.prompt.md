# Bootstrap DARP Repository

## Purpose

Bootstrap the DARP CLI repository.

This prompt MUST be executed only once.

Its sole responsibility is preparing the repository structure for future development.

No business functionality should be implemented.

---

# Context

You are the lead software architect responsible for initializing the repository.

The project vision, architecture and methodology already exist.

Your responsibility is to transform that vision into a well-organized repository.

You are NOT designing the product.

You are preparing the engineering foundation.

---

# Source of Truth

Before making ANY change, read completely:

1. README.md
2. AGENTS.md
3. docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
4. .spec/constitution.md

These documents have precedence over this prompt.

If any contradiction exists:

STOP.

Explain the conflict.

Do not make assumptions.

---

# Repository Development Lifecycle (DDL)

This project follows the DARP Development Lifecycle.

Every future feature will follow:

Vision

↓

Constitution

↓

Project Context

↓

Specification

↓

Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

↓

Implementation Plan

↓

Tasks

↓

Implementation

↓

Review

↓

Release

This bootstrap prepares the repository for that lifecycle.

It does NOT execute any feature.

---

# Mission

Prepare the repository.

Nothing more.

Do NOT implement:

- CLI commands
- Providers
- Registries
- Package manager
- MCP support
- Asset loading
- Business logic
- APIs
- Networking
- Configuration loading

No executable feature should exist after this prompt.

---

# Execution Protocol

## Phase 1

Inspect the repository.

Understand the existing documents.

Identify missing repository components.

---

## Phase 2

Produce a short Bootstrap Plan describing:

- what will be created
- why it is needed
- expected repository layout

Proceed automatically unless a major architectural conflict is found.

---

## Phase 3

Bootstrap the repository.

You may create:

directories

placeholder files

README files

templates

tooling configuration

documentation skeletons

workflow skeletons

development configuration

Nothing else.

---

## Phase 4

Validate the repository.

Verify consistency with:

README

AGENTS

PROJECT_CONTEXT

Constitution

---

## Phase 5

Produce a Bootstrap Report summarizing:

Directories created

Templates created

Configuration files created

Documentation created

Recommendations

Future work

---

# Expected Repository Structure

The final repository should resemble:

```text
docs/
    PROJECT_CONTEXT.md
    ROADMAP.md
    architecture/
    adr/
    specs/

.spec/
    constitution.md
    templates/
    archive/

.github/
    workflows/
    prompts/

.codex/

assets/
    copilot/
    codex/

cmd/

internal/

pkg/

test/
```

Create missing directories only when appropriate.

Do not overwrite existing documentation unless necessary.

---

# Templates

Create reusable templates for:

Specification

Architecture Decision Record (ADR)

Implementation Plan

Tasks

Every template should explain:

Purpose

When to use

Expected sections

Completion criteria

Do NOT create example implementations.

---

# Tooling

Prepare the repository for modern Go development.

Examples include:

.editorconfig

.gitignore

Makefile

golangci configuration

GitHub workflow skeletons

Keep tooling lightweight.

Prefer standard Go tooling.

---

# Documentation

Every architectural directory should contain a short README explaining:

Purpose

Contents

How it participates in the development lifecycle

Documentation should be concise.

Avoid unnecessary verbosity.

---

# AI Optimization

Optimize the repository for:

GitHub Copilot

OpenAI Codex

Future AI agents

Repository structure should be:

predictable

discoverable

easy to navigate

easy to index

---

# Architectural Principles

Always preserve:

Low coupling

High cohesion

Deterministic behavior

Explicit dependencies

Provider agnostic architecture

Small reusable components

Incremental evolution

Readable documentation

Avoid:

Premature abstraction

Speculative features

Unnecessary dependencies

Hidden behavior

Magic configuration

---

# Validation Checklist

Before finishing verify:

✓ No CLI implementation exists.

✓ No business logic exists.

✓ No providers exist.

✓ No registry implementation exists.

✓ No MCP implementation exists.

✓ Templates are reusable.

✓ Documentation is internally consistent.

✓ Repository follows the Constitution.

✓ Repository is ready for the first Specification.

---

# Expected Deliverable

The repository should resemble a mature open-source project that has not yet implemented its first feature.

After completion the next activity should be writing the first Specification.

Nothing beyond repository preparation should be implemented.
